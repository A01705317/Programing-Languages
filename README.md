Final Project - Concurrency - Java

IDEA OF THE PROJECT

The purpose of this project is to implement the programming paradigm of concurrency to simulate the use of machines or cash counters. The idea is to provide companies with a tool that helps calculate, at a specific day and hour, the ideal amount of machines or cash counters that need to be working in order to maintain short lines, but also keeping the operating costs low.

I decided to develop this project to help companies, mainly because of two reasons:

1. When lines are too big, the persons decide to leave and go to other establishment or company, therefore the establishment looses clients or commissions for    lost transactions.

2. When establishments have more machines or cash counters working than needed, the machines or cash counters generate unnecessary expenses for the companies.

So basically, the idea is to maintain the lowest number of machines or cash counters working, but always keeping a small line of persons waiting.
